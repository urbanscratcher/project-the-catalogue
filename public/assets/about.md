### How I Began

I acquired my software engineering skills through hands-on experience in the real world while working part-time in 2015. It was during the winter break of my graduate school program, where I was assigned simple office tasks. The project involved converting an ERP system written in DOS into a GUI-based system.

As I worked on the project, I soon realized that the DOS system was incredibly inefficient. Everyone, including the staff and new team members, constantly complained about its drawbacks. Even though I wasn't an expert in data structures, being a social scientist and urban planner involved in quantitative analysis with various datasets, I had a basic understanding of relational databases. Through some reverse-engineering, I figured out the structure of the data stored in the dbf files and discovered that Microsoft Access allowed real-time data sharing through files. This revelation gave me the confidence that the conversion was achievable. Encouraged by this, I dared to ask if I could take on the task of converting the system.

No compensation was requested since the project wasn't officially planned. There was no guarantee of its success, just a strong desire to make it happen. Once my boss gave me the green light, I started by compiling a list of existing functionalities and actively sought input from people on what should be added or removed. This marked my first foray into discussing user requirements! I taught myself how to use Microsoft Access to create forms for CRUD operations, queries to extract and display data, and implemented features for printing, descriptive statistics, and searching. I felt like a master of MS Access at that point. Throughout the development process, I worked closely with the actual users, receiving daily feedback on various functionalities and the user interface. After a month of intense work, I successfully migrated the data and launched the MS Access program I had built. The program continued to serve its purpose for five years until an official program was adopted.

Looking back, this experience laid a strong foundation for my software development journey. Surprisingly, there was hardly any coding involved, except for some SQL-like statements. Thanks to MS Access, the process of writing those statements was made easy. What astonishes me the most is that I went through all the steps without any knowledge of software engineering concepts. It's incredible to think that even as a novice, as long as one can think logically and has a genuine desire to simplify people's lives, they can build something remarkable.

### How I Used to the Actual Coding

After that experience, I decided to further my academic journey and pursued a Master's degree in Urban Planning at Iowa State University. During my studies, I took a Python for Automation class and a Satellite Image class. In the Python class, I learned the fundamentals of Python for data manipulation and became comfortable writing scripts, as I was an end-user of tools like ArcGIS and math libraries. In the Satellite Image class, I gained insights into fundamental concepts such as supervised and unsupervised learning, which introduced me to the world of machine learning. This deepened my passion for coding even more. For my final project, I utilized Beautiful Soup to scrape HTML elements and automate data extraction. Along the way, I also learned the importance of respecting data ethics. This experience highlighted the need to handle data responsibly and ethically, which further enhanced my understanding of the broader implications of coding and data manipulation.

### How I Entered the Dev World

After the Covid break, I returned to my home country. I liked research but had a stronger desire for stable income from having a job. To pursue a career in software development, I enrolled in a bootcamp that offered courses on Java, SQL, HTML, JavaScript, and the Spring framework. Learning Java and SQL during the bootcamp was an enriching experience, with a particular highlight being the introduction to the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP). I found OOP to be philosophically beautiful, as it provided a structured and elegant approach to software design. My previous experience working with relational data proved to be immensely helpful as I delved into SQL. It was like fitting together puzzle pieces seamlessly. I built various portfolios during the bootcamp, showcasing my skills, and eventually landed my first job as a backend developer. It was an exciting step forward in my career journey.

The first task at hand was to analyze the existing data structures as the company planned to migrate from a monolithic system to a microservices architecture (MSA) while also incorporating a hybrid setup. This task presented its challenges, given the numerous services already in production. Our team decided to begin by identifying and separating points of interest. I took the lead in creating diagrams as a draft and collaborating with the team to discuss the proposed changes.

While my senior focused on maintaining the existing services and leading backend service, my role involved developing new APIs for the homepage CMS, authentication, and the point system. Additionally, I was responsible for building a simple API gateway and a migration program. As the company had chosen a specific tech stack, I took it upon myself to learn TypeScript, NodeJS, Express/NestJS, TypeORM, and Swagger. These experiences were invaluable in teaching me not only the importance of development itself but also the significance of effective teamwork and communication in practice.

### What's Next

1. **Filling the Gaps**

   - I know I have to fill the gaps in the fundamentals of computer science.
     - Started UoL distance learning.
     - Udemy, Coursera courses.
   - Specifically:
     - Backend: Blah blah.
     - Frontend: Blah blah.

2. **My Recent Interest Areas**

   - Domain: Built-environment like real estate, architecture, and buildings, environment, energy.
