# The Catalogue

May 2024 ~ June 2024 (3 weeks)

This is a catalog concept website developed for showcasing my portfolio.

## Features
- **Portfolio List**: A summary list of each project with thumbnail videos that play automatically on hover. All data is synced with a Notion database.
- **Project Details**: Integrated with GitHub repository README markdown files for detailed project descriptions.

## Technical Focus
- I explored the possibility of using Notion as a backend and discovered the Notion API, which I used to manage projects.
- In Notion, I recorded metadata for each project such as descriptions, roles, tech stacks, and links.
- Due to Notion CORS issues, I set up a proxy using Cloudflare Workers.
- Since I usually organize projects in the README files, the project details page converts GitHub README markdown files to HTML instead of using Notion pages.

## Reflection
- I was initially stumped by the CORS problem but found a solution through a Stack Overflow post and set up a proxy using Cloudflare. Notion API doesnâ€™t support CORS, making it inconvenient for client-side use. Later, I realized that static page rendering via server components could have been a better solution.
- I had a specific style in mind inspired by Pinterest but opted for a simpler design to expedite development. I need to focus on the essentials and avoid getting sidetracked by new ideas.

## Next
- I want to enhance the site with 3D rendering.
